Additionally, a bonus won't increase the employer's expenses for benefits like life insurance, retirement contributions, and disability insurance that are calculated as a percentage of an employee's basic salary. Additionally, a bonus system enables companies to offer rewards to great workers who already receive the highest pay scales for their ranks or to do so when budget constraints prevent wage increases. A lump-sum bonus may result in greater productivity gains due to the psychological boost it offers.</p>",

Your bonus can be much smaller than you anticipate due to the way bonuses are taxed (for your information, all types of bonuses are taxable in Ghana, Nigeria and Gambia).  If you consider your bonus to be a part of your salary, you run the risk of overspending, incurring debt, or just feeling very let down when bonus time comes around if the bonus isn’t what you expected. </li><li><strong>Spending your bonus before you even get it: </strong>It\'s typical to buy a big item on credit with the expectation that you\'ll pay it off when you get your bonus. However, a bonus is never guaranteed, so it could not be as substantial as you anticipate. The "big buy" typically loses its appeal by the time you finally have the money to pay for it, which makes you want to make another one in order to get the bonus boost you were hoping for. </li></ul>',
